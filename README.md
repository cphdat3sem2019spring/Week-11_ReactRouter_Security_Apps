## Thuersday - React Native-2 /(Futures, Callables and Asynchronous Rest) 

Complete the [exercises](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InOKIB8hLsjKCtjrqkgtQIDHDorMEvpE_j12MMvU1Vk/edit#heading=h.ixjgmzszw27t) from React Native Day-1.

We will do (or start on)  "Apps with a backend" together. This requires that you have installed [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) before the lesson - A super cool tool that will allow you to open servers running locally on your laptop to the "whole world".

For the rest of the day this is the plan:
- If you have completed the exercises related to Futures/Callables from last week, just do the "All the fun" exercise if you have come to "love" React Native and have the time
- If not, I will, as promised repeat the lecture related to Futures/Callables from 10.00 - 12.00
